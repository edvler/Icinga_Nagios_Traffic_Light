Icinga Nagios Traffic Light

This is a simple project for icinga (https://www.icinga.org/) or nagios (http://www.nagios.org/).
Both are monitoring systems for IT infrastructures. Almost everything can be monitored, from a simple host to a complex services.
But at the end it's realy simple. In Icinga an nagios are 3 major possible states avaliabe.
Each service or host could be in one of the following states:

- good (green)
- warning (orange)
- red (critical)

This is where my traffic light comes in.
It is used to bring the actual overall state of the monitoring system to a traffic light.
